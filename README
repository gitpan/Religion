 Religion 1.03 - Improve die() and warn() handling.

 Copyright (C) 1995, Kenneth Albanowski. Unlimited distribution and/or
 modification is allowed as long as this copyright notice remains intact.

This module, Religion, provides simplified access to $SIG{__DIE__} and
$SIG{__WARN__} (which allow control over what happens when a die() or warn()
occurs), and (as a side effect) enhances the standard error messages, which is
especially useful if you are dealing with eval()'s.

Simplest usage:
